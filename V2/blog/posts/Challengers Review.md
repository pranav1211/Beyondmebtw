Review 52 - Challengers (2024), Dir. Luca Guadagnino.

---

I’m a sucker for dramas and don’t mind the occasional romance. Shows like _Desperate Housewives_ and _Revenge_ are my thing and I’ve even enjoyed sports dramas like _Rush_, _Ballers_, and _Inside Edge_.

What initially drew me in was Zendaya and what looked like an intriguing sports movie. Little did I know it would be right up my alley. Another bonus? The main cast was absolutely hot—even the guys. They were all effortlessly attractive which only added to the appeal.

### The Story

The story itself is solid it employs a past-and-present narrative structure, seamlessly blending flashbacks with the current timeline. This approach provides essential context without slowing the pace or causing confusion when past events are referenced.

_Challengers_ isn’t just a love triangle or a romantic drama. It delves into the complexities of relationships, intertwining emotional baggage, ambition, and betrayal. The interplay between past and present highlights how decisions ripple through the characters’ lives, shaping their dynamics over time.

The final act is especially gripping, with scheming and betrayal taking finally culminating. Patrick subtly signalling Art to lose focus and the reveal of Tashi orchestrating Patrick’s loss showcase the characters' layered motivations. The climactic match is a masterstroke—Patrick loses, but the subtle smile exchanged between him and Art speaks volumes. It’s a moment of mutual understanding with Tashi’s triumphant cheer tying everything together beautifully.

At times, it might feel like polygamy could have prevented this but life is not that simple. The layers of jealousy and ambition complicate everything. Art envies Patrick for winning Tashi. Patrick wants to be Tashi’s equal. Art finds comfort in being dominated by her. After Tashi’s injury, she channels her ambitions through Art as his coach. Patrick’s suggestion to make her his coach, despite her initial disgust, hints at her calculating mind—she's aware that Art might be burnt out so her acceptance reflects her ambition as she can continue her legacy through Patrick.

Art’s shock when Tashi casually agrees to his retirement leading to the playful scene of him sprawled on the bed with Zendaya’s hand on his face and then resting his head on her lap, subtly reveal the intricacies of their dynamic. The story expertly showcases how complex and messy their relationships truly are.

Even the scene in Atlanta, where Art sees Patrick and Tashi talking, adds an interesting layer to the story. There’s a moment where Art looks away for just a second and when he looks back, they’re gone. It subtly plants the idea that Art might piece things together and allow his jealousy to fuel him.

Art’s displeasure with Patrick and Tashi’s relationship is evident throughout the film. He even seems to sow discord between them during the sequence before Tashi gets injured. His comments create tension leading to their argument. As a result, Patrick isn’t present when Tashi breaks her leg, but Art is right there and that incident plays directly into his favour.

It’s these nuanced interactions that add complexity to the characters’ dynamics, making their relationships feel layered and emotionally charged.

### The Cast

Zendaya’s performance is a standout. She captures the subtleties of her character’s development with effortless expressions and mannerisms, making it feel as though the role was tailor-made for her. Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor are equally brilliant. Their acting, body language, and chemistry with Zendaya make their dynamics feel incredibly real. The casting is nothing short of perfect.

### Edging the Audience

I’m not usually a fan of how modern movies rely on explicit sex to establish connections; it often feels lazy and unnecessary. _Challengers_, however, takes a different approach. While it doesn’t feature overtly explicit sex scenes, it leans heavily into softcore eroticism. Lingering gazes, intimate touches, and passionate kisses build the tension. Sex is present but never shown directly, with the focus instead on the aftermath.

This subtle approach is incredibly effective, teasing the audience just enough to keep them intrigued without crossing into excess. It keeps you on edge, maintaining a sense of thrill and leaving you wanting more.

The flashback kissing scene where the trio takes things further didn’t feel uncomfortable; instead, it was passionate, heated, and oddly natural. Even the moment when the two boys kissed didn’t feel out of place. Interestingly, Guadagnino specifically requested this addition to the script. As Kuritzkes mentioned, “Luca felt it was very important that, in any love triangle, all the corners touch.” And he meant it literally.

Another moment that stood out was the churro scene. Strangely sensual, the biting of the churro and the playful smiles carried a subtle, homoerotic undertone that was both captivating and memorable.

### Cinematography

The cinematography is a masterpiece. The way the camera captures the characters, their emotions, and the subtleties of their expressions is incredible. For example, Tashi’s disgusted reaction when Patrick asks her to be his coach is so perfectly captured that you can almost feel her revulsion.

The tennis scenes are on another level. The immersive camera work—including moments where the perspective mimics the movement of the ball—is brilliant. Innovative angles, like top-down views, first-person perspectives, and shots from beneath (as if the court were made of glass), add a unique flair. It’s refreshing to see such creativity in cinematography outside of action movies.

The intimate scenes are handled beautifully, avoiding clichéd or awkward angles. Instead, the shots feel intentional, sometimes placing the audience in a first-person perspective, which adds an emotional depth rather than feeling exploitative.

_Challengers_ to me isn’t just about love or sports. It’s a story of power, vulnerability, and the tangled web of human connections. It delivers on every front.

A must watch (just don’t watch it with family or friends) 10/10.
