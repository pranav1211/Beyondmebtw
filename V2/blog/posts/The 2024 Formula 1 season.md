### The 2024 Formula 1 Season Review

I never understood the appeal of Formula 1. To me, Formula 1 was just cars going around in circles — a repetitive and pointless activity. It was one of those things I would mock without giving it a second thought.

But then, in March 2024, a friend suggested I give it a try, “Why not?”. That’s how I ended up catching part of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and from the moment I tuned in, I was hooked. All I could think was, Where have you been all my life?

After that i saw every race and every race highlight i could find and it was incredible. I began to understand the brilliance of Formula 1. It’s not just cars racing in circles. It’s strategy, skill, precision, and drama , all rolled into one high-octane package. The deeper I went, the more captivated I became, and now I can’t imagine a life without this sport.

**A Deep Dive into F1: Drivers, Races, and Drama**

It’s been a month since I started writing this and while it’s taken longer than planned, I’m finally here to wrap up the 2024 F1 season with my thoughts. Let’s dive into the drivers, the races, and all the drama that made this season unforgettable.

#### Max Verstappen: The GOAT in the Making

Max Verstappen has cemented himself as one of my favourite drivers. Initially, I was drawn to him because of the polarizing opinions surrounding him, everyone seemed to hate him simply because he was too good. There’s something magnetic about someone so unapologetically excellent and Max’s “I’ll do whatever I want” attitude. His confidence and ability to call out nonsense was refreshing.

It’s funny looking back, my first full GP was Australia, where Max DNFed, but now, I can confidently say I’m a fan for life. Despite the challenges this season, Max proved why he’s a champion. Even during his winless streak between Spain and Brazil, he consistently performed at the top level, making the most of every opportunity. His rain-soaked drive in Brazil was legendary, a true testament to his skill.

Also 2021 was Max’s championship, not Lewis’.

### Lando Norris: A Star in the Making

There’s no denying Lando Norris’s talent. From the races I’ve watched, his ability to compete at the top and often outperform his teammate at such a young age shows immense promise. I was genuinely happy when he secured a win in Miami, he truly deserved it. By that point, I had seen enough highlights and Drive to Survive episodes to recognize his skill and potential.

After Red Bull’s downfall Norris started to emerge as a potential threat. However, I don’t think he was mentally ready to take on the pressure of fighting for a world championship. This isn’t to say he doesn’t deserve one, but it felt like the weight of expectations, from his team, family, and even the online world, might have become overwhelming.

The mental strain of being under such scrutiny can affect anyone and I think that pressure showed. It led to a lot of bottled starts and a visible struggle to keep his cool, even though he managed to recover in certain races. It’s hard not to wonder if something deeper was going on beneath the surface.

This pressure also seemed to manifest in some harsh remarks and outbursts. I’m not excusing his bad behaviour, but I can see where it might have come from, when it feels like the world is against you, it’s easy to lash out.

I’ll be honest: there were times I didn’t want him to win certain races. It felt like his raw talent wasn’t fully translating into results and that was frustrating to watch. McLaren’s role in this can’t be ignored either. They built a fast car, but their strategy was questionable. If anyone’s to blame for Norris not winning a world championship this season, it’s McLaren.

The Hungary race is a prime example. McLaren’s decision-making, like forcing Norris into an undercut to make him faster, only to then to blackmail him, felt like a disservice to both him and Oscar Piastri. Rumours about team orders and Piastri’s contract added fuel to the fire, but realistically, those are just distractions. The real issue was poor strategy that put the team at risk of even losing the Constructors’ Championship.

Despite everything, Norris remains an intriguing figure. He’s a nice guy with a bit of an edge, an attitude that can work for or against him. I like him, though I wouldn’t call myself a die-hard fan just yet. I genuinely hope he wins a world championship in the future because he has the skill and potential to make it happen. Time will tell how his story unfolds, but I’m rooting for him to rise above the challenges.

### Oscar Piastri: The Rising Star

Oscar Piastri quickly became one of my favourites. Maybe it’s my soft spot for Aussies but there’s something about him that resonates with me. He’s cool, calm, and immensely talented.

Hungary was a stellar drive for Oscar, though McLaren’s strategy made it a weird win. In Azerbaijan, he proved his mettle, holding his own against Leclerc despite having the faster and maybe illegal car. For someone in just their second season, his performance was impressive, even if inconsistent. I have no doubt he’ll be a WDC contender in the future.

### Lewis Hamilton: A Love-Hate Relationship

Lewis Hamilton is a legend, no doubt about it. On track, though? I can’t stand him. He has a tendency to throw tantrums and shift blame when things don’t go his way, which drives me crazy.

Off the track, however, I have nothing but respect for him. His advocacy for diversity, F1 Academy and other initiatives is truly commendable. While I’m not a fan per se, I can’t deny his skill and achievements. He’s a GOAT and I’m curious to see how his Ferrari stint pans out. As a Max fan, I hope it doesn’t go too well, but you never know!

### Ferrari: Charles and Carlos

Charles Leclerc’s performance largely depends on Ferrari’s capabilities. While races like Monaco were outliers, he showed skill in others like Baku, Texas and Monza. Ferrari has potential, but I don’t see them winning the WDC or WCC in 2025.

Carlos Sainz, on the other hand, has faced some tough luck. His move to Williams feels like a fresh start and I’m excited to see him showcase his true abilities there.

### George Russell: Drama Magnet

George Russell loves drama, it’s almost entertaining. However, his tendency to deflect blame and stir the pot behind the scenes is frustrating. Mercedes seems to have struggled in this new era, but I’m intrigued to see how they bounce back. Also, shout-out Susie Wolff, I admire her leadership and contributions to the sport.

### Other Teams and Drivers

**Alpine**  
Alpine is ass. After their dominant Renault era, it’s been one disappointment after another. The only real highlight was Ocon’s win, and they still managed to snub him. Honestly, it feels like they’ve been dragging the sport down. The French team’s management decisions often come off as arrogant and short-sighted. I hope they get bought out completely so we can stop watching this train wreck.

As for the drivers, Gasly is decent. He’s not world championship material, but I can see him picking up a couple more wins. Ocon, on the other hand, has shown great consistency. He’s kept his composure during wins and even held his own against Max in Brazil, which isn’t easy. I’m genuinely excited to see him with Haas. I think Alpine did him dirty and made him less likable through their chaos. Watching earlier seasons of _Drive to Survive_ compared to the later ones made that crystal clear. Seeing him in Haas gear felt like a fresh start, I like him again.

**Haas**  
The American team really stepped up in 2024. Gunther Steiner was fun before, but it feels like he stopped caring for a while. 2024 with Komatsu they really cooked, Kevin and Nico showed solid skill. Their 2025 lineup of Ocon and Ollie looks promising. If they keep their heads down and avoid unnecessary drama, I think Haas can realistically aim for 5th place and maybe even snag a couple of podiums in 2025. For a small team, they’ve got a lot of potential and I genuinely like them.

**VCarb**  
I don’t like the concept. It’s stupid, but I’ll save the details for another time.

**Yuki Tsunoda**  
Tsunoda’s a nice guy with solid skills. He’s a Honda-backed driver, and that’s probably why he’ll never make it to Red Bull. Still, he’s fun to watch, and I hope he continues to grow.

**Sergio Perez (Checo)**  
I love Checo. His resilience through career ups and downs is inspiring and made me a fan. There’s something relatable about his struggles, falling short of your full potential while everyone around you seems to be excelling. I was heartbroken to see him leave, Azerbaijan was another kick in the nuts. He’s someone I’ll always root for, and I hope we see him back in the paddock someday.

**Liam Lawson**  
I have mixed feelings about Lawson. He’s talented, but I think he’s been set up to fail. I like him, partly because he likes the movie _Cars_ , but beyond that, nothing stands out yet. Let’s see how his career unfolds.

**Sauber (Alfa Romeo)**  
I don’t have much to say about Sauber. Zhou’s a nice guy, and Valtteri Bottas is just awesome, I’m a fan of him and his calm and straightforward approach.

**Aston Martin**  
Lance Stroll needs to go. He seems like a nice person, but he doesn’t have the talent to justify his spot on the grid. Alonso, on the other hand, is old but still exciting to watch. His enthusiasm is infectious, and I’m curious to see how the rumored Newey-designed car works out for him.

**Williams**  
Williams is fine. I liked Claire Williams and her story, it’s clear she did her best under tough circumstances, and the team’s struggles weren’t her fault. Williams has potential, and I hope they continue to rebuild and climb up the ranks.

Each team and driver brings their own unique flavor to the grid, but some need to step up, while others just need to let go. It’ll be interesting to see how the upcoming seasons shape up.
