[[Reviews]][[f1]]The F1 75 event at the O2 in London was nothing short of a spectacle. If you’re wondering why there’s such a grand event just to reveal car liveries, don’t overthink it—just revel in the excitement of F1 content to tide us over until the season kicks off. 

Here’s a breakdown of everything that went down.

---

The event kicked off with a brilliant monologue by Jack Whitehall, who absolutely nailed it. His humor was sharp, and his charm ensured the jokes landed perfectly. From poking fun at the sheer scale of the event just to showcase barely changed car livery to poking about the Verstappen and Russell feud. His crack about Zak Brown’s tattoo's and joking that it made him look like Post Malone was also funny. What could’ve come across as cringy felt genuinely enjoyable thanks to Jack’s effortless charisma.

### The Reveals: Let’s Talk Liveries

#### **Kick Sauber**

This year’s Sauber has opted for a more matte finish with a subtle faded effect, a significant upgrade in style from last season. It’s sleek, sophisticated, and undeniably good looking. Now, the hope is that the car’s speed matches its aesthetic, it’s not just about looking pretty on the grid, after all.


---

#### **Williams**

Williams has gone for a darker blue at the front, which gradually lightens as it moves toward the rear, creating a smooth gradient effect. It’s a nice touch, adding depth to the livery. While the absence of the Williams logo on the spoiler feels a bit nostalgic, kudos to the team for landing a major title sponsor. Let’s just hope they spend less time crashing and more time scoring points this year.


---

#### **VCARB**

Not gonna lie—VCARB absolutely cooked with this one. The white design, punctuated by the Red Bull logo near the engine intake, is clean and striking. It’s like the Honda one-off 2021 livery vibes and it looks phenomenal. Can’t wait to see Yuki Tsunoda and Isaac Hadjar take this beauty for a spin.


---

#### **Haas**

Haas means business this year, sporting a deadly black-and-white color scheme. The choice to use a black Haas logo on the sidepods instead of the works incredibly well. This livery screams aggression and speed, here’s hoping it delivers on the track.


---

#### **Alpine**

Alpine stays true to its signature blue-and-pink combo, but this year’s iteration has a refined metallic finish and a striking two-tone design, with the pink more prominent at the front nose. It’s a subtle yet classy evolution of their livery. Now the big question: will it be as fast as it looks?

### Bonus Moment: FIA Gets Booed

In true F1 spirit, the crowd booed the FIA. Mad scenes. Let’s go!

### Aston Martin

Aston Martin leaned fully into their James Bond heritage, and as a Bond fan, I loved every second of it. They played the iconic Bond theme, and the drivers even got in on the action with some cool theatrics. Lance Stroll’s helmet also caught my eye, great design.

Speaking of the livery, it’s a subtle evolution from last year’s, leaning into a lighter shade of green with a touch of white at the engine intake. It’s not a drastic departure, but it’s still sleek and classy. The launch trailer added to the cool factor, and Fernando Alonso’s cheeky comment, “You’ve now seen the best livery tonight,” was sweet.

### Mercedes

Mercedes brought some fun to the stage by performing a pit stop live, but, It wasn’t fast.

As for the car, it’s not a massive change from last year, but it does lean more heavily into silver, with much less of the red Ineos branding. While not particularly striking, the overall look is clean and polished. A solid, understated design that sticks to the team’s identity.

### Sidenote: Thank You, Gordon Ramsay

A shout-out to the man himself for calling out the FIA and swearing on live TV. He is the GOAT.

---

### Red Bull Racing

Let’s me be honest, there’s nothing new here. It’s literally the same livery as last year, and if there are any differences, they’re too small to notice. But as a Red Bull Racing fan, I dont car about the livery i just need the car to be fast. Here’s hoping they dominate the track this year.

### Ferrari

Sebastian Vettel wasn’t wrong, there’s something about Ferrari that commands respect. Their aura is truly unmatched. The intro video was nothing short of spectacular. From the tribute to Enzo Ferrari to showcasing the evolution of Ferrari’s F1 cars, it was a perfect celebration of their legacy.

But let’s talk about the car. Honestly, it’s not terrible, I thought adding more HP logo's and color would make it look terrible but it actually works. The white and the red work well together. Not bad. Excited to see what holds for them this year. The color below the rear wing is blue with the IBM logo and that also looks good.



---
### Mclaren
It's the same car, subtle changes. Why fix it if it ain't broke. Excited to see if they can still keep up this year.

To wrap things up, I actually enjoyed the event. It was fun, lighthearted, and gave us a much-needed dose of F1 before the season kicks off. The combination of glitzy reveals, humorous moments and some cool livery designs made it worth tuning in.

Let's get this show on the road!!!!!
