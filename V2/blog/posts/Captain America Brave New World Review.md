Review 54 — Captain America: Brave New World (2025), Dir. Julius Onah.

The movie follows Anthony Mackie telling Harrison Ford, “Hey big guy the sun’s getting real low.”

Note: I realized that after writing my thoughts, there are some serious issues with this movie, so here's what I suggest: Watch it, enjoy it, don’t think too much about it.

### The Plot

The biggest issue with the plot, for me, is that it feels like it’s trying to juggle too much while not giving enough depth to the storylines it introduces. Don’t get me wrong I had a lot of fun watching this movie. It has action, thrill, and drama, and it was an absolute joy to see Anthony Mackie finally getting his well-deserved spotlight as Sam Wilson. Harrison Ford brought his classic charisma, even if his character could’ve been better developed. The movie also did a decent job making sense of the world post-blip, something the MCU has often struggled with. But when it comes to the core of the story, the villains, the character arcs, and the stakes, it felt like missed opportunities piled on top of each other.

The villains are the clearest example of this. Samuel Sterns’ return could’ve been a brilliant callback to _The Incredible Hulk_, but instead, it felt underwhelming. He’s portrayed as ruthless, but his motivations are either underexplained or rely too much on the audience remembering a movie most people barely associate with the MCU anymore. There’s potential in his revenge story, but he’s not menacing or layered enough to leave an impact. Giancarlo Esposito’s Sidewinder is even more of a disappointment. He’s criminally underused, especially considering his talent. it’s frustrating because these characters could have elevated the stakes, but instead, they’re just… there.

Sam Wilson’s journey, while compelling, also feels like it’s treading old ground. His struggles with identity and acceptance as Captain America are real and necessary, but at some point, we need to see him fully embrace the mantle and move forward. That said, his chemistry with Joaquin Torres is fantastic, and Torres brings a lighthearted energy that the movie really needs. Isaiah Bradley’s presence is another highlight, but even he feels underutilized. His character has so much depth, but the movie doesn’t fully capitalize on it, leaving me wanting more.

The action and thrills are good but not great. The movie has its moments, Sam’s flying and fighting sequences are spectacular around the Celestial but use the Celestial to make it grander, and there’s definitely some excitement in the camp exploration scenes but it never reaches the heights of something like _Civil War_. That movie felt epic because it had the weight of an Avengers-level conflict, and this one just doesn’t. For a Captain America movie, the stakes should feel bigger, the threats more dire, and the narrative tighter. Instead, it feels like they were playing it too safe.

### **The Villains**

### Samuel Sterns

Samuel Sterns is revealed as the main villain, and I immediately recognized him from _The Incredible Hulk_. His story works—he’s back for revenge after being used and lied to by Ross—but it doesn’t land as well as it could have. A lot of people don’t even remember him because, let’s be honest, most people didn’t watch _The Incredible Hulk_ or didn’t realize it’s a part of the MCU. There’s no real explanation for why he’s back, and it leaves the audience confused.

They could’ve made him so much cooler by building up his “Mr. Blue” identity from _The Incredible Hulk_ and evolving his character—bigger brain, bluer appearance, something to make him menacing and stand out more. While his ruthlessness is effective by showing him killing people left and right, it’s not enough. Also, for someone who’s supposed to be a genius, how did he not anticipate that Sam is smart enough to outmaneuver him?

### Sidewinder

Then there’s Sidewinder, played by Giancarlo Esposito. He’s the leader of the Serpent Society but barely gets any screen time. Honestly, it’s such a waste of Esposito’s talent. They could have tied the plot into something larger like Hydra’s resurgence or a new cosmic threat to make them more interesting. Instead, he’s just a pawn, and it’s disappointing.

### Captain America

Sam’s journey as Captain America has been anything but easy. The Blip, the struggles we saw in _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_, and now dealing with bureaucrats and people who can’t accept him as Captain America because he’s not Steve Rogers—it’s a lot. There’s even a moment where Ross (Harrison Ford) tells him outright, “You’re not Steve.”

However, the movie misses the mark on fully embracing his internal struggles. While it touches on his identity crisis, it doesn’t give him enough moments to shine as the symbol of hope and justice he’s meant to be. The question of whether Sam should take the super-soldier serum is also teased again, and honestly, it’s time to resolve this once and for all. Either give him the serum or move on—it’s exhausting to keep revisiting it.

#### Joaquin Torres

Joaquin is fantastic. He’s cheerful, loyal, and exactly the kind of sidekick Sam needs. Their chemistry is great—it reminds me of the dynamic between Steve and Sam. Seeing Joaquin step up as the new Falcon is awesome, and I hope we get to see more of him in the future. He is a number-one yapper.

#### Isaiah Bradley

Isaiah’s story is so powerful. I loved seeing more of him in this movie. He’s a deeply layered character. His story sheds light on the injustices of the past while also showing his growth and recognition in the present. His story highlights the dark side of the government’s actions. He’s hesitant about trusting anyone, and honestly, who can blame him after everything he’s been through? But it’s heartwarming to see him in a better place now, getting recognition and building relationships with Sam and Joaquin. It’s a nice evolution from where we saw him in _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_. His interactions with Sam and Joaquin are heartwarming, and I really hope to see more of him in the future.

### Ruth Bat-Seraph

She is an interesting addition to the film, bringing a unique dynamic with her political spy role. Her character is intriguing because she operates differently compared to the usual political personas. Her actions make her feel like a wildcard, and while her role adds tension, it could’ve been even more impactful with a bit more screen time to flesh out her character. Her action sequence was well done, and she wasn’t annoying. She kind of reminded me of Romanoff from _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_. I hope the MCU explores more of her in future projects.

### Thaddeus Ross/Red Hulk

Harrison Ford does an excellent job as Thaddeus Ross, stepping into the late William Hurt’s shoes with ease. However, the script doesn’t do his character justice. As President of the United States and the Red Hulk, Ross should command more presence and ruthlessness. The Thaddeus Ross we saw in _Civil War_ was far more compelling. While I agree the character is older, that is no reason to not be an absolute menace. While Ford delivers his lines with gravitas, the character’s arc feels underwhelming, especially when compared to his potential.

### Final Thoughts

Ultimately, I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it could’ve been so much better. The potential was right there, but it didn’t quite stick the landing. It has strong performances and thrilling moments but underdeveloped villains, unresolved character arcs and a lack of truly gripping stakes preventing it from reaching the heights of its predecessors. It’s frustrating because, with a few small changes and a bit more ambition, this could’ve been one of the standout entries in the MCU. Instead, it’s fun but forgettable, which isn’t what Captain America deserves.

Still, as a fan, I couldn’t help but enjoy the ride. Anthony Mackie shines and carries the mantle with pride and seeing the more of the post-Blip world adds depth to the MCU. Here’s hoping future projects capitalize on the potential that this movie teases.
