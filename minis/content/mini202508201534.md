# F1 haptic

When the F1 haptic trailer first dropped, it was one of those moments where you just sit back and think, WOW. The way it synced the visuals with the feel of the phone was honestly so cool to witness. There was just one problem: it was iPhone only.

I don’t have an iPhone. So instead of just sitting on the sidelines, I took it as a little challenge. Why not try recreating it for Android? I had even found out how to trigger vibrations on Android that very day and bookmarked the site, but of course, it just stayed there. Procrastination kicked in hard, and what I thought I’d get done quickly ended up being pushed aside for weeks.

Finally, I sat down and gave it a go. The end result? It came out surprisingly well. Sure, it might be a bit rough around the edges, I’m not going to pretend it’s pixel-perfect or super polished, but it still feels powerful when you actually use it. There’s something satisfying about creating an experience that you thought was out of reach.
