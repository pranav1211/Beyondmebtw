    "rawMarkdown": "# Triple Threat\n\n---\nI ended up watching **Venom 3: The Last Dance**, **Kraven the Hunter**, and **Madame Web** back to back. Venom was fine, but the other two, oh my god. I’d heard the talk about how bad they were when they first released, but seeing them myself was something else entirely. Some of them don’t even warrant full reviews, so here are three short ones instead.\n\n---\n\n**Venom: The Last Dance (2024)**  \nIt’s dumb, but it’s sweet and somehow that’s exactly why it works. Probably the only Sony Spider-Man villain to actually make it through a full trilogy, Venom goes out on a surprisingly fun and heartfelt note. The plot is decent, a little messy in places, but never boring. The dancing scene with Mrs. Chen? Adorable. And Eddie saying goodbye to Venom with **Memories** by Maroon 5 playing in the background unintentionally hilarious, but still kind of touching. The Venom trilogy might and will be Sony’s best work: fun, ridiculous, but never dull. **10/10**\n\n---\n\n**Kraven the Hunter (2024)**  \nNot even “fun bad,” just bad.
